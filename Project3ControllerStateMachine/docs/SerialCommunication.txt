System starts in initialization, transitions to Preoperational on its own

In Preoperational:
    p=1.34: -> sets Kp to 1.34
    i=0.45: -> sets Ki to 0.45
    O -> transition to Operational

In Operational:
    S -> Transition to Stopped
    P -> Transition to Operational

In Stop:
    O -> Transition to Operational
    P -> Transition to Preoperational
    I -> Transition to Initialization

In Initialization:
    (nothing)
